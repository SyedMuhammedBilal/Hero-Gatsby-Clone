description: "In 2010, UNTUCKit Founder and Executive Chairman Chris Riccobono was on the hunt for a shirt that looked good untucked. He quickly realized that it was a hard style to get right—traditional men’s dress shirts were too long and looked sloppy when worn untucked."

<p>After hearing friends echo his frustrations, Chris came up with the idea for UNTUCKit: a polished yet casual shirt designed to be worn untucked. Chris quickly got to work re-engineering the dress shirt with the perfect untucked length to help men look sharp, even at their most casual.</p>

<p>Beyond reimagining the perfect untucked shirt length, Chris focused on reworking contoured hemlines, reinforced collars, and developing a signature sail. Tying it all together is the amount of fits available for every body type: 50+ for every shape and size.</p>
